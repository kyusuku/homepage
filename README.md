# Homepage

Homepage is a browser-based web project created as part of my journey through The Odin Project curriculum. This project focuses on building a professional-looking personal homepage using clean CSS layouts and responsive design principles. The page features a profile image, an "About Me" section, a "Projects" section, and a "Contact Me" section.

## How to Use

- 🖼️ **View Profile:** The homepage showcases a profile image alongside an "About Me" section.
- 💬 **Explore Projects:** Browse through the "Projects" section to see featured work.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Resize the window or open on different devices to see how the layout adapts seamlessly.
